        <h2>All about Shelties</h2>
        <!--have a brief history of shelties here. Will go more in depth as the website gets further developed-->
        <p>Shelties originated in the Shetland Islands of Scotland, a remote and rugged region known for its harsh climate and small livestock. Much like the small Shetland pony, the Sheltie was bred to be a miniature herding dog, capable of working in challenging conditions.</p>
